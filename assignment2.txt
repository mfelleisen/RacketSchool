Dear student, 

Here is the second assignment in preparation for the Racket Summer School
of Semantics and Languages. This assignment aims to introduce the basics 
of Racket-style language development on a lightweight basis. 

Please work your way through 

  [3] Realm of Racket, the last chapter, titled ")" or "close paren"
  http://pdf.th7.cn/down/files/1312/Realm%20of%20Racket.pdf

  Its third section is a concise introduction to rudimentary Racket
  concepts of language development.  

  You can find PDF copies of Realm of Racket on line by googling. The
  listed link points to a complete copy of the book.  The book is also
  available for purchase in hard copy and PDF from No Starch Press. The
  Publisher is aware that readers have leaked PDFs to the Web.


  [4] F*dging up a Racket
  http://www.hashcollision.org/brainfudge/

  Danny Yoo's write-up has become a classic among new Racket programmers
  who wish to go beyond the programming languages and study the 
  programming-language programming language instead. 

Unless you are a well-versed Racket programmer, both of these readings will
introduce you to new concepts. Indeed, the second one may in parts go
beyond the summer school material, especially when it comes to parsing
surface syntax. 
 
So please try to wrap up the first "homework" and move on to these two
readings.
