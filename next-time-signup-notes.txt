2. Ask Butterick to publicize. He seems to draw in a lot.

3. Change the form:

The question "Tell us a little more about your status" is pretty confusing ("status"?).

Again, the question "Are you a FUNDED attendee (US university)?" is confusing, because some of them might be funded by someone else, themselves, etc. We mean "are you funded by US". (Of course, with a better join operator we wouldn't need this question at allâ€¦)
