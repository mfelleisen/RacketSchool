1. Send mail to Racket list first.

2. Ask Butterick to publicize. He seems to draw in a lot.

3. Change the form:

The question "Tell us a little more about your status" is pretty confusing ("status"?).

4. The confirmation form is here:

Again, the question "Are you a FUNDED attendee (US university)?" is confusing, because some of them might be funded by someone else, themselves, etc. We mean "are you funded by US". (Of course, with a better join operator we wouldn't need this question at allâ€¦)

5. For those who claim they don't want dorm housing, send an *explicit* message saying "you have indicated you DON'T want to stay in the dorm, we assume you will make alternate arrangements", etc.
