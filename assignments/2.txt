Dear student, 

Here is the second assignment in preparation for the Racket Summer School
of Semantics and Languages. This assignment aims to introduce the basics 
of Racket-style language development on a lightweight basis. 

Please work your way through:

* Realm of Racket's last chapter, titled ")" or "close paren".

  Its third section is a concise introduction to rudimentary Racket
  concepts of language development.  

  [If you own the book, great. If you want, you can purchase PDF or
  hard copy from

  https://www.nostarch.com/realmofracket.htm

  You can also find free illicit copies on the Web; e.g.:

  http://pdf.th7.cn/down/files/1312/Realm%20of%20Racket.pdf

  works for now. The publisher is aware that readers have leaked the
  PDF to the Web.]

* F*dging up a Racket:

  Danny Yoo's write-up has become a classic among new Racket
  programmers who wish to go beyond the programming languages inside
  Racket and study the programming-language programming language
  nature of Racket.

Unless you are a well-versed Racket programmer, both of these readings
will introduce you to new concepts. Indeed, the second one may in
parts go beyond the summer school material, especially when it comes
to parsing surface syntax.
 
So, please try to wrap up the first "homework" and move on to these
two readings. They are challenging and will take some effort, and you
may not feel you have mastered the material when you are done. That's
okay: what matters is trying to work through them.
