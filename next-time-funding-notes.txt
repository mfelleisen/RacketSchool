Ask industrial participants to contribute something up front: $250? We got very few industrial donations but did get some, so there's a trade-off between a few big donations and several smaller ones.

Ask for money from:

- NSF (Anindya)
- Jane Street
- SIGPLAN

[[Record here what needs to be done to actually get the $ from all these sources.]]

Ask advisors to have some skin in the game by paying about 10% of student costs.
