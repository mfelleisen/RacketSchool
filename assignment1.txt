Dear student, 

Welcome to the Racket Summer School of Semantics and Languages. 

The goal of the first assignment is to establish basic familiarity
with (mostly)(*) functional programming in Racket. Here are the two
readings:

  [1] Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures 
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html

  [2] More: Systems Programming with Racket
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/more/index.html

If you are already a comfortable Racket programmer, you may not find
anything new in the above; that's fine. We have a very broad range of
applicants, and it's important for us to bring everyone up to speed
and on the same page before we begin. The later homeworks will teach
you new content. (Note: If you have experienced only the Racket
teaching languages, as in an introductory course, do not assume that
you are sufficiently familiar with Racket.)
 
Please start working through these readings. In a few days we will
send you a second assignment. The subsequent ones will dive more into
language creation with Racket.

(*) Racket is not ideological about functional purity.
