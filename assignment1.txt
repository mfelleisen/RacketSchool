Dear student, 

Welcome to the Racket Summer School of Semantics and Languages. 

The goal of the first assignment is to establish basic familiarity
with (mostly)(*) functional programming in Racket. Here are the two
readings:

  [1] Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures 
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html

  [2] More: Systems Programming with Racket
  https://docs.racket-lang.org/more/index.html

If you are already a comfortable Racket programmer, you may not find
anything new in the above; that's fine. We have a very broad range of
applicants, and it's important for us to bring everyone up to speed
and on the same page before we begin. (Note: If you experienced the
Racket teaching languages in an introductory course, do not assume
that you are sufficiently familiar with Racket.)
 
Please work through these readings over the next two weeks. The
teaching languages are miniscule subsets of Racket proper and use
syntactic variants of Racket constructs.

In about ten days we will send you a second assignment. The subsequent
ones will dive more into language creation with Racket.

(*) Racket is not ideological about functional purity.
