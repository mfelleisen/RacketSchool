Dear student, 

welcome to the Racket Summer School of Semantics and Languages. Now that we
have a confirmed list of attendees, it is time to send you the first
assignment -- as promised in the announcement. 

The goal of the first assignment is to establish basic familiarity with
(mostly)(*) functional programming in Racket. Here are the two suggested
readings: 

 [1] Quick: An Introduction to Racket with Pictures 
 https://docs.racket-lang.org/quick/index.html

 [2] Real of Racket, especially the last chapter on very simple
 language-oriented programming:

 See NoStarch for a sample chapter: 
   https://www.nostarch.com/download/samples/Realm_ch14.pdf
 PDFs should be available on-line. 
 
Please work through these readings over the next two weeks. If you
experienced the Racket teaching languages in an introductory course, do not
assume that you are sufficiently familiar with Racket. The teaching
languages are miniscule subsets of Racket proper and use syntactic variants
of Racket constructs. 

In two weeks from now, we will send you a second assignment that dives into
some more syntax-oriented programming because Redex modeling needs a
thorough understanding of this idiom.  The third preparatory assignment
will ask you to deal with the creation of a language.

(*) Racket is not ideological about functional purity.
